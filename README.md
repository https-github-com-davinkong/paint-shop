# paint-shop
In the paint shop there are several clients each with one or more jobs to be done. 
There are also several contractors who work on and complete jobs. 
Each job will require one or more paint products to be used in order to complete the job. 
The shop owner should be able to see a list of all the upcoming scheduled jobs and for each job, which client it is for and which contractor is responsible to complete the job. 
The shop owner should also be able to see the paint products required for each job. 
Contractors should also be able to view their upcoming jobs, clients, and which paint products they will be needing.
