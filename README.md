Welcome to PaintersPro, a Java and Spring Boot web application. PaintersPro helps shop owners track and manage their projects. Shop owners can see all upcoming scheduled jobs along with client and product information. Additionally, contractors are able to view their upcoming jobs. 

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Hibernate;
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf



## Features

 - ðŸ“¹ Full video walk-through: Coming Soon
### Login and Register
- Contractors can add themselves to the database. We use BCryptPasswordEncoder to encode the userâ€™s password to the hash string for better security. 
-  We also set the role if users are contractors or shopOwner, by using boolean isAdmin true or false.

### Jobs   
- The jobs page provides a form that allows contractors and shop owners to add a new job to the system.
- The job object is then saved, and the corresponding Contractors object is marked as having a job assigned.
